Hello World

So I have begun my journey into Data Science. I have been reading many articles online, and many of them mention making a Data Science Portfolio. Yes, it is that important that I capitalized it. So important and fascinating, that I have decided to see what it is all about. I am starting with a clean slate, as if I have not learned anything before. Heads up, I have my B.S. in mathematics from UT Austin. Time to change to world :D.

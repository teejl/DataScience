Hello World

So I have begun my journey into Data Science. I have been reading many articles online, and many of them mention making a Data Science Portfolio. Yes, it is that important that I capitalized it. So important and fascinating, that I have decided to see what it is all about. I am starting with a clean slate, as if I have not learned anything before. Heads up, I have my B.S. in mathematics from UT Austin. Time to change to world :D.


The Theory of Traffic

The most efficient way to drive is to never press the brake. Everytime the brake is press it is just integrating the waste of fuel. This kills our bank account and enviroment that surrounds us. That is to say that traffic must never slow down. I am mainly referring about on the highway, a road with no stop lights. It seems that most of the stopping comes from the reduction of lanes on the highway, however if everyone had the patience to drive a little slower we could all still be moving and minimize our brake time.

I looked more into Data Science today, and found out more of what a data scientist does. It seems a prime example of a data scientist is the person who makes the recommended "becuase you liked this you will like this" of sort. For example, if you are on an online website buying skinny jeans, there might be a side tab referring you to other types of skinny jeans. I'm sure there are amounts of data one can use to find the algorithm that works, but it is the algorithm that makes the data scientist powerful. It is the intellectual curiosity that fuels his drive. All of which fuel my mind. A prime example is the theory of traffic. Perhaps one day I'll be able to find a simple algorithm that can solve traffic, or maybe just minimize our brake time. Nevertheless, I will be doing O.S.S. to become closer to my goal to find these algorithms.
